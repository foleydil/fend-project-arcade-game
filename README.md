## Overview

This is the "Arcade Game Clone" project, a part of the Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program.

The program is a clone of the classic video game Frogger, using HTML/CSS and vanilla Javascript.
To play, open `index.html` in a browser.

The user must use the keyboard's directional buttons to move the character from the bottom of the
screen to the top. If they collide with an enemy, their position resets. When the user wins, they receive
a congratulatory message, and the game resets. This version of the game also randomizes the character at the beginning of each game (on page load or after winning).

## Dependencies

Image resources are local.

This game incorporates some JavaScript ES6 elements, and may not work on older browsers or those not compatible with ES6 features.

## Contributing

This repository is my completion of a Udacity Nanodegree project. Therefore, I will most likely will not accept pull requests.
